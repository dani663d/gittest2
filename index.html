        WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SONG

        its a really really really funny song

        Oh, sinner, do not stray
        From the straight and narrow way
        For the Lord is surely watching what you do
        If you approach the Devil's den
        Turn 'round don't enter in
        Lest the hand of the almighty fall on you.
        He'll f*** you up (he'll f*** you up)
        Yes, God will f*** you up
        If you dare to disobey his stern command.
        He'll f*** you up (he'll f*** you up)
        Don't you know he'll f*** you up
        So you better do some prayin' while you can.

        Long ago a man named Lot
        Had a wife he thought was hot
        But she could not stop her black and sinful ways.
        You know it was her own d*** fault
        When God turned that b**** to salt.
        That's the way he used to work back in those days:

        He f***** 'em up (he f***** 'em up)
        He really f***** 'em up
        When the people went and turned their backs on him
        He can f*** you up (he'll f*** you up)
        No s*** he'll f*** you up
        Just like he f***** the people up back then.
        I used to have a friend named Ray
        Who walked that evil way
        He cursed and drank and broke his neighbor's fence
        You know Ray was full aware
        That some sheep were over there
        And he knew them in the Biblical sense.

        God f***** him up (he f***** him up)
        He went and f***** Ray up
        Went and paid him back for all his wicked sins.
        He f***** him up (he f***** him up)
        f***** that boy completely up
        Now he's married to a Presbyterian.
