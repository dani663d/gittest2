        Oh, sinner, do not stray
        From the straight and narrow way
        For the Lord is surely watching what you do
        If you approach the Devil's den
        Turn 'round don't enter in
        Lest the hand of the almighty fall on you.
        He'll f*** you up (he'll f*** you up)
        Yes, God will f*** you up
        If you dare to disobey his stern command.
        He'll f*** you up (he'll f*** you up)
        Don't you know he'll f*** you up
        So you better do some prayin' while you can.
